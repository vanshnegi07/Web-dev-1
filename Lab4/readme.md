# 🎮 Prompt Quizzer – Lab 4 (Web Dev-I)

**Name:** Vansh Negi  
**Course:** B.Tech CSE (AI & ML)  
**Semester:** 1st Sem

**Roll No:** 2501730158 
**University:** K.R. Mangalam University, Sohna  

## 💡 About My Project
So this is my Lab 4 assignment for Web Dev-I. We had to make a small quiz game using only JavaScript and run it in the **browser console**.

The quiz asks questions using `prompt()` and then shows whether the answer is right or wrong using `alert()`. I added 7 questions from GK and computer basics (because honestly, those are easier to remember 😆).

## 🤓 What I Learned While Making This
Being a beginner, I actually learned quite a lot:
- how to store questions in an array of objects  
- looping through questions using a `for` loop 🔄  
- using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` so answers don’t get marked wrong just because of capital letters  
- showing instant feedback  
- making a simple score system  
- adding an option to replay the quiz at the end  

This is probably the first JS program I made that actually interacts with the user 😄

## ▶️ How To Run The Quiz
1. Open Safari (or any browser).  
2. Right click → Inspect → go to **Console**.  
3. Copy all the code from `quiz.js`.  
4. Paste it in the console.  
5. Press Enter and the quiz starts immediately 🎯  
6. Answer the questions one by one and check your final score!

## 📁 Files in My Repository
- `quiz.js` → my complete JavaScript quiz code  
- `README.md` → this file you’re reading  

## 📝 Extra Notes
I tried to keep the code clean and understandable.  
It’s not very advanced (I’m still in 1st sem 😅) but it works fine.

Also yes, I added a "play again" option because it looked incomplete without it 😂

In the future I might try adding:
- MCQs  
- different difficulty levels  
- maybe a timer ⏳  
- and a nicer scoring message  

If I get time… hopefully 😄
